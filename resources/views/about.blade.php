                            <p>We offer compassionate comfort, palliative and hospicecare to each individual in order to alleviate the symptoms of physical and mental stress caused by a serious or life-limiting illness. For those near the end of life, palliative care, or comfort care, focuses on achieving the highest possible quality of life and the control of pain, other physical symptoms and of psychological, social and spiritual issues is paramount.<br/>
But, while palliative care offers many benefits to the patient, researchers are finding that caregivers do not get overwhelmed down the road when their loved one receives palliative care.<br/>
Helping seriously ill patients be more comfortable can reduce the stress on their caregivers.</p>

<h4>Our approach to palliative care:</h4>
<ul>
<li> Multidisciplinary approach</li>
<li> Patient and caregiver education about the disease and treatment</li>
<li> Pain control by Nonnarcotic and Narcotic pain meds along with other modalities of pain control.</li>
<li> Surgical procedure to relieve symptoms as needed</li>
<li>   Provide Assessment, Diagnosis and treatment of ongoing and new medical problems as they arise</li>
<li>  Nutritional support including tube feeding</li>
<li>   Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation to improve quality of life and Activities of Daily Living</li>
<li>  Provide Home Care as and when needed</li>
<li>   Psychosocial and emotional support</li>
<li>  Stress relaxation through Yoga, Meditation & other relaxation techniques.</li>
